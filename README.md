# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a beginner in the world of coding, and I'm excited to share my journey with everyone.

## About me

### ðŸŒ± Learning
I'm currently learning both Python and C, Python attracted me beacuse of its beginner-friendliness and versatility, while C drew me in with its lower-level programming capabilities, allowing me to understand more about how computers work

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
My main objective is to explore different branches of programming to find my niche. I want to create projects tha are fun and educational, and commit a lot of error so i can learn from them.

### âš¡ Some websites im in for learning and fun
